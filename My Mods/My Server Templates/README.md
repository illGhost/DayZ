# My Server Templates
Here you'll find my Quick-Start templates. These are server templates designed to help speed up your server setup process. You can drag and drop these files directly into the server.


**What's included?**
- Edited types files
- Boosted loot
- Boosted events
- Faster log-in time
- Trader files
- Different map setups
- Trash loot removed (nurse scrubs, pen, kitchen timer, etc)

I can teach you in my discord or even build your server for you. You can find all sorts of information here: https://discord.gg/qTbTuMwb6F
